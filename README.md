# Web Augmentation: Taking Back Control of the Internet

## TL;DR

Web Augmentation is a new paradigm that lets developers modify, automate, and share any web applicationâ€”without access to its code. It creates a programmable overlay on top of the existing web. In this post, we explore how the web became closed, how Web Augmentation re-opens it, and why itâ€™s vital for the age of agentic AI.

## Introduction: The Web Wasnâ€™t Meant to Be This Way

The early web was open, remixable, and transparent. You could view source, copy styles, tweak scripts. It was a playground. Fast forward to today, and we live in a maze of locked-down SaaS apps, obfuscated interfaces, and rigid integrations. Developers are boxed in, users are disempowered, and progress is slowed by walled gardens.

But what if we could reclaim control?

## The Problem: A Web You Can't Touch

Modern web apps are:

- **Opaque**: No way to tweak UI or logic unless you own the code
- **Unfriendly to automation**: DOMs shift, flows break, captchas stop scripts
- **Anti-collaborative**: No multiplayer, no shared sessions, no agent interfaces
- **Fragile**: Geo-blocks, CDN restrictions, app updates, and browser quirks constantly break workflows

Developers already *want* more control:

- >100k browser extensions exist, but they're siloed and hard to scale
- Teams build entire internal tools just to patch gaps in third-party apps
- AI agents (like GPT or Claude) can reason, but still canâ€™t *act* reliably across the web

Meanwhile, the internet is fracturing:

- Chrome dominates the browser market (65%+), effectively controlling standards
- Centralized CDNs like Cloudflare can cut off entire regions
- Geopolitical forces now shape internet accessâ€”from Russia to Utah

Weâ€™re using the web, but we donâ€™t control it.

## Enter Web Augmentation

Web Augmentation is the ability to modify, automate, and share **any** web applicationâ€”instantly and safelyâ€”without needing code access. It turns the browser into a programmable layer.

Unlike extensions, it scales.  
Unlike middleware, it works without backend integration.  
Unlike remote browsers, it's fast and native.

It gives developers the power to:

- Change UI elements in real time
- Automate flows like a human would (but faster)
- Record, audit, and observe sessions
- Share web sessions with humans *or* AI agents

The core idea: Treat the web as a *canvas*, not a fixed product.

## How It Works (at a Glance)

Web Augmentation is powered by a tech stack called **Virtual Web Sessions**, as implemented by [Webfuse](#):

- Proxy-based virtualization layer
- Secure DOM rewriting and request handling
- Full JS sandboxing
- REST and JS APIs to control tabs, sessions, roles, events
- Extensions and Automations to customize behavior

You can:

```js
// Open a virtual session with tabs
session.openTab("https://example.com");
session.openTab("https://github.com");

// Automate user behavior
await automation.moveMouse(200, 300);
await automation.click("#submit-button");
